<description>This point layer represents train station stops of the Metro-North railroad, a commuter rail system that connects southwestern Connecticut and the Hudson Valley in New York State to New York City. Each point represents a stop at a train station (the center point of the track in front of the station) that serves one or more routes. The unique ID for the features is stop_id, a field created by the MTA. The geoid field indicates which county the stop is located in using the state-county ANSI FIPS code. This layer was created by the GIS Lab at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layer series, to provide access to mass transit features for basic geographic analysis and map making. The data was generated from the MTA's static data developer feeds. It was transformed and generalized from a GTFS format into readily usable GIS features using a series of python scripts.</description>
