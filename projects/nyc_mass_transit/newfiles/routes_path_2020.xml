<description>This line layer represents the train routes and services of the PATH Train, a rapid transit system operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that connects Newark, Jersey City, and Hoboken to New York City. Each line represents an individual train route along physical track locations. The unique ID for the features is route_shor, which is a shortened version of the route's name. The color field includes the official color hex code that's used for symbolizing the routes on maps. This layer was created by the GIS Lab at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layer series, to provide access to mass transit features for basic geographic analysis and map making. This data is an extract from a geospatial data file produced by the NJ Office of Information Technology, Office of Geographic Information Systems, that contained all commuter rail lines in New Jersey.</description>
