<description>This line layer represents the train routes and services of the Metro-North railroad, a commuter rail system that connects southwestern Connecticut and the Hudson Valley in New York State to New York City. Each line represents an individual train route along physical track locations. The unique ID for the features is route_id, a field created by the MTA. The color field includes the official color hex code that's used for symbolizing the routes on maps. This layer was created by the GIS Lab at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layer series, to provide access to mass transit features for basic geographic analysis and map making. The data was generated from the MTA's static data developer feeds. It was transformed and generalized from a GTFS format into readily usable GIS features using a series of python scripts.</description>
