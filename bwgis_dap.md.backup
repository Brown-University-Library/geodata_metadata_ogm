## Metadata Elements and Vocabulary

This document describes the standards  we use (i.e. data application profile) for creating Dublin Core metadata records to describe datasets that we produce at GeoData@SciLi at the Brown University Library.

Our metadata records are encoded in XML and consist of one record per file, using a generic metadata root element. All of the elements are drawn  from the [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) qualified elements (dc) and terms (dct). Most of the elements listed  below are required by our standard and must appear in in the order  presented below. Some elements can be repeated while others cannot; in a few cases an element must be repeated to provide a name in the first  instance and a URL / link in the second instance. The values for many  elements must be drawn from a specific vocabulary or must follow a  specific format. Some of the controlled vocabularies we use include ISO  19115 topic categories for subject elements, geonames for coverage  elements, and the dcterms box format for the spatial element. We adhere  to most of the suggestions and standards employed by the geoblacklight and OpenGeoMetadata communities in the [OGM Aardvark Metadata Schema](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark). When creating or updating records, look at existing as examples for guidance.

| Element             | Source | Required? | Repeatable? | Vocab?                                                       | Instructions                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| title               | dc     | y         | n           | [OGP best practices](http://opengeoportal.io/working-groups/metadata/metadata-creation-guide/) | The name of the resource plainly expressed in the manner in which it's  published, i.e. 'NYC Geodatabase' or 'Tax Exempt Organizations in NYC'.  If it's an individual spatial layer, use the formal title that includes  features, place, and time: 'Subway Routes, New York NY, May 2019'. |
| creator             | dc     | y         | y           |                                                              | The name of the primary person who created the resource. If two or more  people shared equally in creating the resource, or if a person made  significant revisions, add them as an additional creator. Otherwise add  them as a contributor. |
| subject             | dc     | y         | y           | [ISO 19115 Topics](https://www2.usgs.gov/science/about/thesaurus-full.php?thcode=15) | Include as many of the topic categories that apply, but only use ones that  unambiguously describe the resource (read the definitions carefully).  Avoid using the 'location' topic unless the definition specifically  applies to the resource. Follow the capitalization and camel case  syntax. |
| description         | dc     | y         | n           |                                                              | A one-paragraph description of the resource that describes: what it is,  what it contains, how it was created, what it can be used for, and  important caveats or restrictions. Add important details that are  relevant for discovering and describing the resource and incorporate key terms. Avoid embedding information like dates or coordinate reference  systems that need to be updated frequently and / or are incorporated in  other elements. Check your spelling. |
| publisher           | dc     | y         | n           | [LCNA](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html)             | Use the name of the organization that publishes the resource as written in  the LC Name Authority file. If we created it, it should be 'Brown University Library'. |
| contributor         | dc     | n         | y           |                                                              | The name(s) of other people who helped create the resource, or who created a minor or routine update. If the update was a significant revision, add  them as a creator instead. |
| issued              | dct    | y         | n           | W3CDTF                                                       | The date we published or issued the resource, written as YYYY-MM. |
| type                | dc     | y         | n           | [OGM](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/resource-class) | In most cases this will be 'Dataset'. Drawn from OGM resource class values, in turn based on DC. |
| format              | dc     | y         | y           | [OGM](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/format) | The file format of the resource. Use the geoblacklight list for spatial  data. Repeat if this record is used to describe multiple formats of the  same resource. |
| medium              | dct    | y         | n           | [OGM](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/geometry) | The type of spatial format for the source: a type of vector geometry,  raster format, tabular, etc. Use the geoblacklight geometry vocabulary. |
| identifier          | dc     | y         | must        |                                                              | This is an identifier for the resource and must be repeated: the first  instance should be the name of the file with its extension, and the  second should by the full url where the resource is stored without the  file name. We're following this approach because we don't have a  repository where resources have permanent URLs. |
| source              | dc     | y         | y           |                                                              | These are sources that were used to create the dataset: name of department or agency, name of dataset (separated by a comma), i.e. 'US Census Bureau, 2018 American Community Survey'. Do not provide links. |
| language            | dc     | y         | y           | [OGM](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/language) | The language the resource is written in, spelled out in common English  usage, i.e. 'English', 'Spanish', etc. Do not use language codes. |
| is part of          | dct    | n         | n           |                                                              | The name of the collection of datasets to which this file belongs. Check other records to insure you're being consistent. |
| coverage            | dc     | y         | y           | [geonames](https://www.geonames.org/)                        | Names of specific geographic areas or features that contain or cover the  resource. Use geonames for vocabulary and spell out the full place  hierarchy, i.e. New York, New York, United States. The first entry  should cover the largest area that encompasses the resource. |
| spatial             | dct    | y         | n           | [DC Box](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-box/) | A bounding box in the Dublin Core Box format that captures the geographic extent of the resource, and expresses the CRS of the resource if it's  spatial. Provide the name of the geographic area in the geonames format, each of the bounding limit coordinates, units the coordinates are in, and CRS name / map  projection as expressed in [Spatial Reference](https://spatialreference.org/). Use GIS to determine the limits. For spatial data use the CRS that the  layer is in. For non-spatial data use WGS 84 degrees of longitude and  latitude. |
| temporal            | dct    | y         | y           | W3CDTF                                                       | A point in time or time period that the resource covers. For a point in  time specify YYYY or YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD. Be general: only provide the month when source data is updated more than once a year, and the day if updated more than once a month. For time period use YYYY-YYYY for a  range of years. For consistency refer to previous records to determine  how specific you should be. |
| provenance          | dct    | y         | n           | [OGM](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/provider) | The name of the institution that's providing the resource, referred to as Provider in OGM. For us, it's: 'Brown'. |
| rights              | dc     | y         | n           | [OGM](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/access-rights) | Specify as either 'Public' or 'Restricted' .                 |

Provide the name of the  license followed by abbreviations or version number if applicable, i.e. 'Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike CC BY-NC-SA'. |
| accrual periodicity | dc     | y         | n           | [DC Frequency](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/collection-description/frequency/2007-03-09/) | How often the resource is updated. Use subset of terms from DC for  frequency: 'Biennial', 'Annual', 'Semiannual', 'Quarterly', 'Irregular'. |
