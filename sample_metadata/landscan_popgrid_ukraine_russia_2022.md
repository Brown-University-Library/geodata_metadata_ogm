# TITLE
dct_title_s: Gridded Population Data, Ukraine and Russia, 2022

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is gridded raster population data for Ukraine and Russia, produced by Eastview LandScan. From the company's documentation, "LandScan High Definition (HD) provides gridded population estimates at 3 arc-second (~100m) resolution. Values for each LandScan HD cell represent an ambient (i.e., 24 hour average) population count estimate, capturing the potential activity space of people throughout the course of the day and night rather than just a residential location. The LandScan HD model incorporates current land use and infrastructure data from a variety of sources, applies facility occupancy estimates from Oak Ridge National Laboratoryâ€™s Population Density Tables (PDT) project, and leverages novel image processing algorithms developed at ORNL to rapidly map building structures and neighborhood areas using high-performance computing environments." This data was provided via LandScan's website for free download with registration, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Brown University Library downloaded and archived copies for internal use. There are two sets of files, one for Ukraine from January 2022 and one from Russia from October 2020.
