- This is a tabular data file of assessed property taxes for every tax parcel in San Francisco, California that includes street address, parcel ID, and longitude and latitude coordinates.  It was compiled for the CA Property Tax Map, which is an open source project created by Ian Webster that scraped and parsed property tax data from official local government websites in California to create an interactive map of property taxes.
