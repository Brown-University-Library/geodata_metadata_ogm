<description>This data-set is an extract from the IRS Exempt Organizations file that contains records for non-profit, tax-exempt organizations in New York City that filed 990 forms with the IRS. The data was extracted from the IRS Master File Extract for NY State by selecting all 5-digit ZIP codes located in the five boroughs. The list of ZIP Codes was generated by using resources provided by the Missouri Census Data Center (http://mcdc.missouri.edu/), which included tools for the assignment of US Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) to counties and a cross-walk table for relating ZCTAs to all USPS ZIP Codes. The 5-digit ZIP Code and the Census ANSI / FIPS codes for counties were appended to each organization's record, and the city field of the organization's address was cleaned to fix mis-spellings and to standardize names. A separate sheet is included in the dataset with the summary of records by borough and by Exempt Organization Subsection code. Most of the organizations in this data file are classified as 501(3)c, which includes most public charities and private foundations. Additional information about the dataset is provided in the README tab in the spreadsheet.
